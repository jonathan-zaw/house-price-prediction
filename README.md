Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to predict house prices in Bangalore, India. The dataset contains various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and other attributes that influence property prices.

Dataset
	•	Bengaluru_House_Data.csv – The dataset used for training and testing the model.

Files in This Repository
	•	house_price_predict.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow:
	•	Data preprocessing and cleaning
	•	Feature selection
	•	Model training using regression algorithms
	•	Model evaluation and performance metrics
	•	Saving the trained model for deployment
	•	banglore_home_prices_model.pickle – Saved model file for making predictions.
	•	columns.json – JSON file storing column names required for input formatting.
